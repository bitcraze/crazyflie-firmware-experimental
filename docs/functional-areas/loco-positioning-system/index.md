The Loco Positioning System is an absolute positioning system based on Ultra Wide Band (UWB) radios.

Most of the documentation for the Loco Positioning System can be found in the [lps-node-firmware repository documentation](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/repository/lps-node-firmware/master/), this is where protocols, principles and modes are described.

This section contains details specific to the implementation in the Crazyflie, mainly estimator related information.
