This document describes how the Crazyflie high-level commander stores
trajectories in the internal trajectory memory.

Trajectories for the high-level commander may be stored in one of two formats,
either as a sequence of raw 7th degree polynomials, or as a more space-efficient
representation using the same polynomials in Bernstein form. In both cases, a
single segment stores a duration and one polynomial for each of the X, Y, Z and
yaw coordinates of the trajectory.

## Raw representation

The raw representation stores the coefficients of the polynomial describing
the X coordinate of the trajectory first, starting with the constant term and
ending with the 7th degree term, followed by the terms of the polynomials
describing the Y, Z and yaw coordinates, and the duration of the segment itself
in seconds. Each term and the duration is encoded as standard IEEE
single-precision floats, meaning that a single segment requires 132 bytes:
8x4 floats for the X, Y, Z and yaw components per trajectory segment, plus one
additional float per segment to store its duration. Given that the default
size of the trajectory memory is 4 Kbytes, you can only store 31 segments.

## Compressed representation

The compressed representation was designed to be more space-efficient than the
raw representation while still trying to maintain almost the same degree of
accuracy as the raw representation.

The general guidelines of this representation are as follows:

* Durations are represented as milliseconds and are stored as signed 2-byte
  integers.

* Spatial coordinates (X, Y and Z) are represented as millimeters and are stored
  as signed 2-byte integers, meaning that the maximum spatial volume that this
  representation can cover is roughly 64m x 64m x 64m, assuming that the origin
  is at the center.

* Angles (for the yaw coordinate) are represented as 1/10th of degrees and are
  stored as signed 2-byte integers.

* Trajectory segments are described with varying degrees of Bézier curves,
  ranging from degree 0 (constant) to degree 7 (full 7D polynomial, as in the
  raw representation).

The compressed representation starts with the description of the starting point
of the trajectory:

{% ditaa --alt "Starting point format" %}
+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| X coordinate | Y coordinate | Z coordinate | Initial yaw  |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
{% endditaa %}

This is then followed by data blocks describing the individual segments - one
data block per segment:

{% ditaa --alt "Segment list" %}
+------------------+----------------+------------------+----------------+-----+
| Segment 1 header | Segment 1 body | Segment 2 header | Segment 2 body | ... |
+------------------+----------------+------------------+----------------+-----+
{% endditaa %}


The header of a segment is three bytes long. The first byte describes how the
X, Y, Z and yaw coordinates will be encoded in the body of the data block. The
remaining two bytes contain the duration of the segment:

{% ditaa --alt "Segment header" %}
  Bits 6- 7   Bits 4- 5  Bits 2- 3  Bits 0- 1        Byte 2         Byte 3
+------------+----------+----------+----------+  +--------------+--------------+
| Yaw format | Z format | Y format | X format |  | Duration LSB | Duration MSB |
+------------+----------+----------+----------+  +--------------+--------------+
{% endditaa %}

For each of the X, Y, Z and yaw coordiates, there are two bits in the first byte
of the header. `00` means that the coordinate is constant throughout the
section (i.e. it is a zero-order Bézier curve). `01` means that the coordinate
changes linearly (it is a Bézier curve of order 1). `10` means that the
coordinate changes according to a cubic Bézier curve. `11` means that the
coordinate changes according to a full 7th degree polynomial, expressed again
as a 7th degree Bézier curve.

For instance, a header containing `0x0a 0xd0 0x07` means that the segment is
2000 milliseconds long (because `0x07d0` = 2000), and it will have a constant
yaw and Z coordinate. Cubic Bézier curves will be used to describe the X and
Y coordinates of the segment. (This is because `0x0a` = `00 00 10 10` in
binary).

Note that the choice of Bézier curves means that we need to store not the raw
coefficients of the corresponding polynomials (which may be anywhere in the full
4-byte float range), but the coordinates of the _control points_ of the Bézier
curves, whose range is much more predictable and easier to represent with a
fixed millimeter-scale quantization.

The body of the segment is then simply a concatenation of the control points
for the X, Y, Z and yaw coordinates, _omitting the first control point_
because it is always the same as the last control point of the previous
segment. (That's why we needed to store the starting point of the trajectory
separately).

{% ditaa --alt "Segment body" %}
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+------------------------+
| Control points for X | Control points for Y | Control points for Z | Control points for yaw |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+------------------------+
{% endditaa %}


Obviously, when the header specifies that a coordinate is constant, it means
that we do not need to store the control points for that coordinate at all
(there would be only a single control point, but we already know that it is
the same as the last control point of the previous segment). For linear
segments, we only need to store the end of the segment. For cubic Bézier
segments, we need to store the first and second control point and the end
of the segment. This can result in significant space savings if the trajectory
consists mostly of linear segments and cubic Bézier curves, especially if the
yaw does not change, or if the movement mostly occurs in the X-Y, X-Z or Y-Z
plane. Note that cubic Bézier curves are enough to ensure C0, C1 and C2
continuity (in position, velocity and acceleration) for the trajectories.

Internally, whenever the high-level commander starts processing a trajectory
segment that is encoded using the compressed representation, it converts the
Bézier curve back into its raw polynomial representation. It means that most of
the codebase only needs to work with raw 7th degree polynomials.

A downside of the compressed representation is that it is hard to play the
trajectory backwards. The current implementation does not support reverse
traversal at all.
